# MAXToolbar
A toolbar made in MaxScript with various tools. Not in dev anymore, so what you see is what you get.

While it works (at least, worked) in Max 2017, newer changes to MaxScript seems to have broken half the tools and thus rendered using it in those version quasi-useless.

I'm hosting it here both because it could be useful as a learning tool to learn how MaxScript works. I had to do a trial by fire over the span of 6 months and wouldn't wish the same for others. I've attached a lot of documentation in the wiki from said trial by fire, including some tool design documents that explains various downsides to the language.

May you remain sane working with this blasted language.
